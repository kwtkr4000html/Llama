Argument "12fred34" isn't numeric in addition (+) at error.pl line 6 (#1)
    (W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
    that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
    will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
    
    Note that for the Inf and NaN (infinity and not-a-number) the
    definition of "numeric" is somewhat unusual: the strings themselves
    (like "Inf") are considered numeric, and anything following them is
    considered non-numeric.
